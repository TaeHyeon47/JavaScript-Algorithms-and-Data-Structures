/////////////////////
//? Objectives
// ● Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far
// ● Implement merge sort
// ● Implement quick sort
// ● Implement radix sort

//? Why learn this?
// ● The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well (20개 이하 항목 배열과 같이 작은 규모에서 잘 작동)
// ● Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!

//? Faster sorts
// ● There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(N²) to O(n log n)
// ● There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
// ● The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
