//? 자료구조 (Data Structures)
// What do they do?
// ● Data structures are collections of values,
// the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

// Why so many???
// ● Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others(like arrays) are more generally used.

// Why care?
// ● The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.
// ● You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!
// ● And of course... interviews
// ● They all excel in different situations...

// 질문과 올바른 자료구조
// Working with map/location data?
// Use a graph!

// Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?
// Use a linked list!

// Web scraping nested HTML?
// Use a tree!

// Need to write a scheduler?
// Use a binary heap!

// There is a ton of content to take in here...
// don't get overwhelmed trying to master it all at once.
